# Vocal-Stereotypy-Measurement
This Project is the implementation code of the "Machine Learning to Measure Vocal Stereotypy: An Extension" paper.

For the testing, you must first download the model's weight and put the files in the specific folders specified in the "arg_parsing" function. It would be best to create folders that are precisely similar to the function. The link to download the weight is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13284337)


In addition to the code in this repository, we produced software that you can download and install on your Windows PC. The link for the software is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13284337)
